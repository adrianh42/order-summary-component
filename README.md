## My process

I wrote down the semantics of the html first, then classes and all that.
Next I did the CSS styling with SCSS, using a simple anb short CSS-reset I found on css-tricks.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Found out that GitHub is case-sensitive, took me a lot of figuring out to display this markdown and the html correctly. I guess it is a best-practice, lesson learned.

### Continued development

I'm still new to flexbox concepts and I only found out about CSS grid not long after finishing this challenge so I'll learn that next, so I can continue improving making responsive content.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Cool website and has a good almanac of CSS, it has better examples than W3 or MDN in my opinion.
